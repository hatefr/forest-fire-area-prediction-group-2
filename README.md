# Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal, using some meteorological and environmental data. Forest fires are major environmental concerns with the potential of endangering humane lives (Cortez and Morais, 2007). Particularly, here in BC, millions acres of forests are burned annualy, damaging the environment and posing significant financial challenges. Fast-detection of the wildfire and predictions of the burned area are both crucial for a successfull fire monitoring. For this purpose, one can use the information hidden in themeteorological data (such as trends and patterns for the wildfire) and develop a predictive model. 

The data set used in this projcet consists of some meteorological observations (such as temperature, wind, relative humidity etc) and several fire indexes whih are affected by the meteorological conditions. The data set was sourced from `here`??.
